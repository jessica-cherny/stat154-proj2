# trainFeats will be a formula, not a data frame
# Need to pre-process classes for logistic regression:
# right now we have -1 and 1 but logistic needs 0 and 1,
# so re-assign all -1 to be 0 and ignores original 0's.
# classifier needs to be a character string

# lossfunc can be cv error, hinge loss, logistic loss
